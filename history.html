            <h2>Exploring the History and Meaning of Perfume</h2>
            <div>
                <p><strong>If you're here, you might be as obsessed—or at least as passionate—about perfume as I am.
                    So before we dive into perfume history, let's start with a fundamental question:</strong>
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Why do we wear perfume?</strong></h4>

                <p>Dr.Joseph A. Schwarcz, an author and sessional instructor at McGill University, answers this in an
                    incredible
                    way:<em>“The use of perfume is mainly associated with mystery, fantasy, and imagination.
                         We wear Perfume to pleaseothers,to leave a good impression, 
                         to surround ourselves with a pleasing, lingering scent.”</em>
                </p>
            </div>
            <!-- Bootstrap for the img-->

                <img src="assets/images/pexels-mikhail-nilov-history.jpg"
                    class="rounded mx-auto d-block col-12 col-xl-12 pb-4"
                    alt="a perfume bottle with a soft-focus flower in the background.">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    This idea is beautifully echoed in <strong> My Thieving Heart song by </strong> <strong>Sivert Høyem
                        (feat. Marie
                        Munroe)</strong>, where Sivert captures a fleeting yet powerful moment in the lyrics:
                    <em><strong>“The restless city air blends with the traces of your perfume.”</strong></em><br>
                    If you're curious, here's the link to their song:

            </div>
            <div>
                <h3> Other reasons</h3>
                <p>
                    Studying the Science of Scents People sometimes use fragrances not only to make themselves smell nice,
                    but also with hopes of reducing stress, energizing themselves or just lifting their mood.
                    Aromatherapy is the practice based on the notion that scents can affect mood and well-being.
                    There is also “aromachology,” the exploration of the link between fragrances and psychology.
                    A study by the Olfactory Research Fund in New York actually found a 63% reduction in stress in
                    patients undergoing MRI scans when vanilla scent was pumped into the air around them!

                <h3>A Brief Glimpse into Perfume's Origins</h3>
                <p><strong> Although perfume does have a long history but did you know it has not always carried a hint of
                        romance!</strong></p>
                <p>In an article published on March 20, 201, by the Office for Science and Society at McGill University,
                    Dr. Joe Schwarcz, PhD, explains:
                    “The word perfume comes from the Latin phrase,<strong>“per”</strong>
                    meaning <strong>“thorough” </strong> and <strong>“fumus”</strong>meaning <strong>“smoke”.</strong>
                    The French later gave the name “parfum” to the smells produced by burning incense.
                    Indeed, the first form of perfume was incense, first made by the Mesopotamians about 4000 years ago.
                    Ancient cultures burned a variety of resins and wood at their religious ceremonies. Incense made its way
                    to
                    Egypt around 3000 B.C.
                    but until the beginning of Egypt's Golden Age, perfumes were used only in religious rituals.
                    They became available to all Egyptians as the priests gradually relinquished their exclusive rights.
                    Citizens took elaborate baths and soaked their skin in scented oils for pleasure.”
                    <br>
                    The ancient Greeks can take credit for the first liquid perfume.
                    But it was the development of distillation by the Arabs that made perfume manufacture viable.
                    Perfume enjoyed huge success during the seventeenth century, especially in France.
                    Hygiene in those days was pretty spotty and fragrances were used to mask the unpleasant body odors.
                    In England perfumes were used extensively during the reigns of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I.
                    All public places were scented during Elizabeth's rule because she could not tolerate bad smells.

                    <h4>Modren Perfume</h4>
                    <p>
                        As with industry and art, perfume was to undergo profound change in the nineteenth century.
                        Changing tastes and the development of chemistry laid the foundations for modern perfumery.
                        At the turn of the century, perfume usually was derived from a single- flower fragrance.
                        Today, perfumes are extremely complex, made up of many natural and synthetic chemicals,
                        often referred to as “notes” or “overtones.” Chanel No5 was the first perfume created by
                        applying modern chemical principles and the first to contain synthetics.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Eau de cologne, usually used by men, was invented by an Italian barber in the beginning
                        of the eighteenth century in the German city of Köln. Hence the name cologne,
                        the French name for the city. The original name of this concoction was “Aqua Admirabilis” (Admirable
                        Water),
                        and it was sold as a “miracle medicine.” The wonder water was highly praised by Napoleon
                        and was first sold as a fragrance under the name 4711, the address of the first eau de cologne shop in
                        Koln.
                        It is still the world's oldest continuously produced fragrance.
